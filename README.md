# ML_Exam_Project

This repo stores the project I carried out for my Machine Learning exam. 
The aim of the project was not data-oriented but algorithm-oriented: I have been given a random dataset with no contestualized features and I had to test Decision Tree and a Linear-SVM to evaluate which one was getting better scores. I further developed the project with some extras adding a non-linear SVM aiming at a much higher accuracy.
